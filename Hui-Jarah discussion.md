Dear Hui,



So far we've always considered the same two examples: Sine-Gordon and phi^4.  These both have reflectionless potentials.  This means that at leading order (I think this means just H_2 and no H_3,) in kink-meson scattering you always get transmission and never reflection.  This is the dominant interaction, with no lambda, whereas you are calculating the subdominant probability which depends on lambda.



The only paper where we considered a more general model was the one with Chris Halcrow, but it was a specific problem so we don't really have any good checks of the formalism away from the reflectionless case.  There we found that we can't impose g^\ast_k(x)=g_k(-x) but that this is ok, we just drop that condition and make sure that in most formulas with a g_{-k} you instead use g^\ast_k and everything still seemed to work, but we didn't check everything.



So I would suggest the following check, which is nontrivial even for the reflectionless case.  You should calculate the evolution with no H_3 terms, only H_2, so really the dominant evolution with the wave packet.  Then you can calculate the transmission and reflection probabilities (the probability that the outgoing meson has positive or negative k).  You should find that in the case of the phi^4 and Sine-Gordon models, the reflection probability is zero.    You can check it against the results expected from quantum mechanics.



I think that doing this calculation would be useful for a few reasons:



1) It could give you practice, in an easier setting, in handling/interpreting the kind of integrals in your note



2) In the present project, there will be the same issue in the sense that all of the emitted mesons go forward or backward, and when you write your final answer you will have these two probabilities, so you can learn how to recognize them in a setting where you already know the right answer and you can interpret the prefactors in terms of the reflection/transmission calculated in the free case



3) It is a good consistency check that the formalism works for the nonreflectionless case



4) Since you know the answer (in the reflectionless case, or from quantum mechanics more generally) you can see if there are any mistakes in the basic method we are using for these scattering calculations



What do you think?  Can you and/or Hengyuan do this calculation?  It isn't enough for a publication in a top journal although maybe in a bottom journal.
