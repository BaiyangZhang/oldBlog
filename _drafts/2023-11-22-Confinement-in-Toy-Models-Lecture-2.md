### Why Small L?

First, in this setup, a analytical understanding about confinement, chiral symmetry breaking and thermal deconfinement is possible. It is rather rare for a (locally) four dimensional field theory.

Second, a lot of interesting, new properties popped out in this set up, including the molecular topological states, the appearance of doubly-exponential, and the emergence of lattice dimension in the large-N abelian limit. 

Third, they shed light on the possible phase structures on the $\mathbb{R}^{4}$ QFT. That is what toy models usually to, they are simple, theoretically controllable, yet helpful and enlightening.
