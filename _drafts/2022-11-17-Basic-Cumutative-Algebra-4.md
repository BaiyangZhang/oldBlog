### Extension and contraction

Leg $f:A\to B$ be a ring homomorphism. If ${\frak a}$ is an ideal, then $f({\frak a})$ is not necessarily an ideal, since $f$ may maps to only part of the elements of $B$, neglecting some elements to make it an ideal. For example, if $f$ maps $\mathbb{Z}$ to $\mathbb{Q}$, any image of any ideal in $\mathbb{Z}$ is not an ideal in $\mathbb{Q}$. However, we can always construct an ideal generated by $f({\frak a})$, it is called the `extension` of ideal ${\frak a}$, denoted by ${\frak a}^e$,
$$
{\frak a}^e :=  \{ yf(x) \mid x\in f({\frak a}) \}. 
$$

If ${\frak b}$ is an ideal of B, then $f^{-1}({\frak b})$ is always an ideal of $A$, called the `contraction` ${\frak b}^c$ of ${\frak b}$. If ${\frak b}$ is prime, then so is the contraction of it. However, if ${\frak a}\subset A$ is prime, ${\frak a}^e$ need not be prime, take any homomorphism from $\mathbb{Z}$ to $\mathbb{Q}$ for example. 

We can factorize $f$ as follows:
$$
A \xrightarrow{\text{p}} 
$$
