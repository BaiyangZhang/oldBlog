>You had to live – did live, from habit that became instinct – in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized. 

>The horrible thing about the Two Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged to act a part, but, on the contrary, that it was impossible to avoid joining it.

>... And yet the rage that one felt was an abstract, undirected emotion which could be switched from one object to another like the flame of a blowlamp.

Very much like the patriotism, isn't it? So strong and yet so abstract and so easily redirected. And felt so righteous. I must be the most religious non-religion.

>Thought crime is not a thing that could be concealed forever. You might dodge successfully for a while, even for years, but sooner or later they were bound to get you.

>It was always at night – the arrests invariably happened at night. The sudden jerk out of sleep, the rough hand shaking your shoulder, the lights glaring in your eyes, the ring of hard faces round the bed.

This part reminds me of *The Gulag Archipelago* by Solzhenitsyn. Though the depiction in *The Gulag Archipelago* is much better.
