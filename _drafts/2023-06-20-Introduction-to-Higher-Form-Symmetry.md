### Ordinary symmetries

Before going to the generalized symmetries, let's first review some aspects of ordinary symmetries in quantum field theory (QFT).

The derivation of Noether theorem is most familiar to every physicist, so I won't waste time to derive it here. The traditional, or standard way to obtain it is to follow the below given steps.
1. The action is invariant under some *infinitesimal, continuous, global* transformation. However it doesn't mean the the Lagrangian has to be strictly invariant under the same transformation, it can still vary by a total derivative, since its contribution is a surface terms, and for most theoretical setups, everything is set to be zero at the boundary of space time, so the surface terms contributes 
2. 


I just like to mention some of my own philosophical understandings. 

The conserved charge is given by 
$$
\text{Charge} = \int _ {M} \, \text{charge density} 
$$
