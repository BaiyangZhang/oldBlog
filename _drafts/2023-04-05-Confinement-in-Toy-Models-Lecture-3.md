### The dual monopole language in 3D

The IR physics of the 3d Polyakov model is most conveniently described using a dual language. In 3D, the photon field has only one degree of freedom, since Euclidean 3D is the "same" as Minkowski 2+1D, where the photon has no transverse degrees of freedom. Then we can use one scalar field to describe the photon field.

Recall that to obtain the IR theory, in our setup, the W-bosons decouples from the theory for being too heavy, the only light degree of freedom is the massless $U(1)$ field.
