## An introduction to unitary symmetry

The waves in real world usually dissipates in the course of time. As the energy propagates to infinite far in the form of waves, the energy density goes to zero uniformly in spacetime. The same is true for the solutions of wave equations, except for some singular solutions at least. We give a more rigorous definition for dissipation here, a solution of the classical equations of motion is dissipative if 
$$
\lim_{ t \to \infty } \text{max } \mathcal{E}(\mathbf{x},t)=0,
$$
where $\mathcal{E}(\mathbf{x},t)$ is the energy density. 

The interesting thing is that there exists wave functions that allows for non-singular, non-dissipative solutions. In the most striking and simplest case, the solution is time-independent. Somehow, lumps of energy hold themselves together by their own self-interaction.
