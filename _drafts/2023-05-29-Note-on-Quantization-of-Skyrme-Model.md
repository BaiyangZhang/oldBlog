# Static Properties of Nucleons in the Skyrme Model

## Introduction

In his 1973 paper "A planar diagram theory for strong interactions", 't Hooft treated the parameter $N$ in the gauge group $SU(N)$ or $U(N)$ as a free parameter, and explained that in the $N\to \infty$ limit, the Feynman diagrams arrange into sets with different topological structure according to its contribution in powers of $1 / N$. For the sake of simplicity he didn't require the trace of the ${\frak g}$-valued gauge field $A$ to be traceless, thus instead of $SU(N)$ the gauge group is actually $U(N)$. As a result there will be an extra photon corresponding to the $U(1)$ component of $U(1)$, which will be discarded at the last step. 't Hooft introduced the double-line notation and each closed group index circle will generate a factor of $\delta^{i}_ {i}=N$, making it convenient to count the factor of $N$ of a given Feynman diagram. Based on this, 't Hooft made use of the Euler theorem saying that $\chi=2-2g$ where $\chi$ is the Euler characteristic and $g$ the genus of a manifold, and reached the conclusion that, if $g^{2}N$ is kept fixed at large $N$, then *the planar diagrams with genus zero and one  dominate*. That is, to treat the double-line Feynman diagrams as the boundary of a manifold, then we cal talk about the genus of it.
