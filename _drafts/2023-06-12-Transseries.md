### Introduction

In history, formal power series are used extensively for finding the resolution of differential equations. If the resulting power series is convergent, it gives rise to a germ which can be analytically continued to (multi-valued) functions on a Riemann surface. However, very often, the power series we found from solving a differential equation is divergent, then it is not clear *a prior* how to attach reasonable sums to them.

The modern theory of `resummation` was developed systematically by Stieltjes, Borel and Hardy, who invented some resummation methods which *are stable under the common operators of analysis*. Later, Poincare established the equivalence between computations with formal power series and asymptotic expansions. Newton, Borel and Hardy were all aware of the systematic aspects of their theories and they consciously tried to complete their framework so as to capture as much of analysis as possible. The great unifying theory nevertheless had to wait until the late 20-th century and Ecalle’s work on transseries and Dulac’s conjecture.
