### Projective varieties

We learnt about projective algebraic sets, studied its topological properties, like what we did with affine varieties. Our goal in this note is to define a nice ringed space structure on projective varieties, making them into prevarieties. Then we will study its properties. It includes defining the structure sheaf on a projective variety thus making it into a prevariety, and show that the prevariety is separated, and study its properties.
