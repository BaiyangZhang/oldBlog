*Disclaimer: Nothing in this note is original.*

Consider the three Lie algebra generators of $SU(2)$ as three basis, then ${\frak su}(2)$ is a rank three vector space with real coefficients, thus an element of $SU(2)$ can be regarded as a rotation in ${\frak su}(2)$, namely a $SO(3)$ matrix. The adjoint representation of $g\in SU(2)$ acts on ${\frak su}(2)$, 
$$
\text{Ad}: SU(2)\to SO(3)
$$
which is double valued. Inversely, each $SO(3)$ has a double valued representation by $2\times 2$ complex matrices acting on $\mathbb{C}^{2}$. The complex vector $(\psi_ {1},\psi_ {2})^{T}$ on which this $2\times 2$ matrix acts on are called `spinors`.

Mathematicians don't like double-valued anythings since you can't treat them as regular functions. So, we can say that $SU(2)$ matrices naturally furnish a *spinor representation* of the `2-fold cover` of $SO(3)$. When $SU(2)$ is thought of as the 2-fold cover of $SO(3)$, it's called the `spinor group `$\text{Spin}(3)$.
