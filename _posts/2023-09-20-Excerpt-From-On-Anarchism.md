### Introduction

**Ableism:** A term used to describe discrimination, prejudice, or bias against individuals with disabilities. 

**Gender queerness:** Gender queerness is a concept and identity that falls under the broader umbrella of non-binary gender identities. It challenges and rejects the traditional binary understanding of gender as solely male or female. Instead, genderqueer individuals may identify with both genders, neither gender, or a different gender entirely. Here are some key points to understand about gender queerness:
	- *Fluidity*: Some genderqueer people experience a fluid gender identity, meaning their gender identity can change over time or in different circumstances.
	- *Beyond the Binary*: Genderqueer identities are diverse and can include identities like bi-gender (identifying as two genders), agender (lacking a gender or being gender neutral), and more.    
	- *Personal Expression*: The way genderqueer people express their gender can vary widely. Some may choose to present androgynously, some may present in ways that are traditionally associated with men or women, and others may choose an entirely different form of expression.   
	- *Preferred Pronouns*: Genderqueer individuals may use a variety of pronouns. This includes he/him, she/her, they/them, or other neopronouns such as ze/hir.
	- *Cultural and Historical Context*: While the term "genderqueer" is relatively new, the idea of genders outside the binary can be found in various cultures and histories around the world. For instance, some Indigenous cultures in North America recognize Two-Spirit as a distinct gender.   
	- *Not Just About Gender*: For some, being genderqueer also involves questioning or challenging societal norms and roles associated with gender, and not just one's personal identity.
