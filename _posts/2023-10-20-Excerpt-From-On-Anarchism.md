### Introduction

**Ableism:** A term used to describe discrimination, prejudice, or bias against individuals with disabilities. 

**Gender queerness:** Gender queerness is a concept and identity that falls under the broader umbrella of non-binary gender identities. It challenges and rejects the traditional binary understanding of gender as solely male or female. Instead, genderqueer individuals may identify with both genders, neither gender, or a different gender entirely. Here are some key points to understand about gender queerness:
- *Fluidity*: Some genderqueer people experience a fluid gender identity, meaning their gender identity can change over time or in different circumstances.
- *Beyond the Binary*: Genderqueer identities are diverse and can include identities like bi-gender (identifying as two genders), agender (lacking a gender or being gender neutral), and more.    
- *Personal Expression*: The way genderqueer people express their gender can vary widely. Some may choose to present androgynously, some may present in ways that are traditionally associated with men or women, and others may choose an entirely different form of expression.   
- *Preferred Pronouns*: Genderqueer individuals may use a variety of pronouns. This includes he/him, she/her, they/them, or other neopronouns such as ze/hir.

**Zapatistas:** The Zapatistas, officially called the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN), is a revolutionary leftist group that originated in Mexico in 1994. The group is named after Emiliano Zapata, a leading figure in the Mexican Revolution who advocated for land reforms and the rights of peasants. Here are some key aspects of the Zapatistas:
- **Indigenous Rights**: A significant aspect of the Zapatista movement is its emphasis on the rights and autonomy of indigenous peoples in Mexico. Much of the EZLN's membership consists of indigenous people from various ethnic groups.
- **Form of Struggle**: After the initial 1994 uprising, the Zapatistas transitioned from a traditional armed struggle to a more peaceful, grassroots, and civil resistance. They prioritize community-based initiatives and projects over direct military action.
- **Autonomous Municipalities**: The Zapatistas established "caracoles" (snails) and autonomous municipalities in Chiapas. These areas are governed by local assemblies and function outside the traditional political system of Mexico.
- **Subcomandante Marcos**: One of the most well-known figures of the Zapatista movement is Subcomandante Marcos (also known as Subcomandante Galeano since 2014). He served as the movement's spokesperson and is recognized for his writings, which mix revolutionary theory with poetic and mythical elements.

**Black blocs:** The term "black bloc" refers to a tactic often used by protesters, rather than a specific group or organization. Participants in a black bloc wear all-black clothing and cover their faces with masks or bandanas to maintain anonymity, create a unified presence, and avoid identification by law enforcement or surveillance.

**Occupy Wall Street:** Occupy Wall Street (OWS) was a protest movement that began on September 17, 2011, in Zuccotti Park, located in New York City's Wall Street financial district. It was initiated by the Canadian activist group Adbusters and subsequently spread to cities across the United States and around the world. The primary slogan of the movement was "We are the 99%," which highlighted the increasing income and wealth inequality in the U.S., drawing attention to the concentration of wealth in the top 1% of the population.

Here are some key aspects and outcomes of Occupy Wall Street:

- **Goals and Grievances**: The movement was largely about economic inequality, corporate influence over the democratic process, and the perceived failures of Wall Street and big banks, especially in the wake of the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Protesters also voiced concerns about issues such as student loan debt, foreclosures, and the influence of money in politics.
- **Leaderless Structure**: OWS was deliberately leaderless and used a consensus-based decision-making process. General Assemblies were held where participants could discuss issues, make decisions, and plan actions.
- **Encampments**: Inspired by the initial occupation of Zuccotti Park, similar encampments sprang up in various cities around the U.S. and the world. These became sites of community, discussion, and often faced police evictions.
- **Impact on Discourse**: While OWS did not have a specific set of demands or a unified platform, it significantly impacted public discourse. Concepts like income inequality and the "1%" became more mainstream topics of discussion in the media, among politicians, and in everyday conversations.
- **Criticism**: The movement faced criticism on various fronts. Some felt that the lack of a clear set of demands or a centralized leadership made the movement ineffective. Others believed that certain actions or behaviors by protesters detracted from the movement's broader goals. 
- **Legacy**: While the encampments and direct actions associated with OWS dwindled by 2012, the movement's broader impacts can still be seen. It influenced subsequent social movements and brought attention to economic inequality, which remained a significant topic in subsequent political campaigns and policy discussions.  
- **Connection to Other Movements**: OWS shared tactics, ideas, and personnel with other movements and causes, such as Black Lives Matter, the Fight for $15 (a campaign for a higher minimum wage), and even the 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns of Senator Bernie Sanders.

Â **corporatocracy:**  A system in which power effectively rests with a small, elite group of inside individuals, sometimes from a small group of educational institutions, or influential economic entities or devices, such as banks, commercial entities, lobbyists that act in complicity with, or at the whim of the oligarchy, often with little or no regard for constitutionally protected prerogative.

**Principal:** Power that isn't really justified by the will of the *governed* should be dismantled.
