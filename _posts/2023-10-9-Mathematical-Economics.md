### Syllabus

**Semester**: Fall 2023

**Duration:** 40 Real hours (54 teaching hours), 3 real hours per class, 14 classes / 7 weeks 

**Lecturer**: Dr. Baiyang Zhang

**Office Address:** N/A

**Email**: [byzhang@henu.edu.cn](mailto:james.fisher@henu.edu.cn)

**Lecture Schedule**: Monday (Teaching building Room 3502) and Wednesday (Room 109, School of Economics ) 2:30 - 5:30

**Classroom:** TBA

**Textbooks and References:**

1. “*Fundamental Methods of Mathematical Economics*” by Chiang and Wainwright

2. “*Introduction to Probability*” by Grinstead and Snell

3. "*Introduction to Linear Algebra*" by Strang.

**Course Objectives:**  This course will include the basics of analysis, derivatives and integration, linear algebra, optimization, and probability, with the goal of preparing students for further course work within the School of Economics.

**Assessment Policy:** The assessments for this course will one final, in addition to several homeworks. Each item is scored on a percentage basis. The final score for the class is the weighted sum of the items’ scores.  The weights are as follows: final accounts for 70% of the final grade, and the homeworks account for the remaining 30% of the final grade.

In general, the final grade is an A when the final score is 85% or better, a B when the final score is between 70% and 84.9%, a C when the final score is between 60% and 69.9%, a D when the final score is between 50% and 59.9%, and an F when the final score is below 50%.  Assessment and final grades, however, may be curved to the benefit of the students.

**Tentative Weekly Schedule:**

CW = Chiang and Wainwright, GS = Grinstead and Snell, W = Wooldridge.

Additional review sessions may be scheduled in advance of exams.

### Introduction and Basics of Analysis

**Mathematical Economics versus Econometrics** 

Econometrics is concerned mainly with the measurement of economic data. Hence it deals with the study of empirical observations using statistical methods of estimation and hypothesis testing. Indeed, empirical studies and theoretical analyses are often complementary and mutually reinforcing. On the one hand, theories must be tested against empirical data for validity before they can be applied with confidence. On the other, statistical work needs economic theory as a guide, in order to determine the most relevant and fruitful direction of research.

**Economic Models**

A model is essentially and necessarily an abstraction from the real world. The sensible procedure is to pick out what appeals to our reason to be the primary factors and relationships relevant to our problem and to focus our attention on these alone.

**Mathematics from a bird view**

Explain: Algebra, Geometry, and Analysis.

Most people who have done some high school mathematics will think of algebra as the sort of mathematics that results when you substitute letters for numbers. Algebra will often be contrasted with arithmetic, which is a more direct study of the numbers themselves. 

There is, however, a different contrast, between algebra and geometry, which is much more important at an advanced level. The high school conception of geometry is that it is the study of `shapes` such as circles, triangles, cubes, and spheres together with concepts such as rotations, reflections, symmetries, and so on. Thus, the objects of geometry, and the processes that they undergo, have a much more visual character than the equations of algebra. 

Some parts of mathematics involve manipulating symbols according to certain rules: for example, a true equation remains true if you “do the same to both sides.” These parts would typically be thought of as algebraic, whereas other parts are concerned with concepts that can be visualized, and these are typically thought of as geometrical.

One more symbolic and one more pictorial.

The word “analysis,” used to denote a branch of mathematics, is not one that features at high school level. However, the word “calculus” is much more familiar, and differentiation and integration are good examples of mathematics that would be classified as analysis rather than algebra or geometry. The reason for this is that they involve limiting processes. For example, the derivative of a function f at a point x is the limit of the gradients of a sequence of chords of the graph of $f$ , and the area of a shape with a curved boundary is defined to be the limit of the areas of rectilinear regions that fill up more and more of the shape. 

Thus, as a first approximation, one might say that a branch of mathematics belongs to analysis if it involves limiting processes, whereas it belongs to algebra if you can get to the answer after just a finite sequence of steps.

**Branches of Mathematics**

- Algebra. Deals with number systems, polynomials, and more abstract structures such as groups, fields, vector spaces, and rings. 
- Number theory.
- Algebraic geometry
- Analysis
    - The study of PDE, ODE.
    - Dynamics. What happens when you take a simple process and do it over and over again?
- Logic
	- set theory
	- Category theory
- Combinatorics
- Theoretical Computer Science
- Probability
- Mathematical Physics
