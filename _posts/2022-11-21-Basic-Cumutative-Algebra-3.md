The set ${\frak R}$ of all nilpotent elements in ring $A$ is an ideal, and $A / {\frak R}$ has no nilpotent elements. To see that ${\frak R}$ form an ideal, convince yourself that the addition of two nilpotents is still a nilpotent. 

**Definition.** The ideal ${\frak R}$ of nilpotent elements of $A$ is called the `nilradical`. The nilradical is also the intersection of all the prime ideals of $A$.
