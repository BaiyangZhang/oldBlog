The lack of simple connectivity is but one measure of topological complexity for a space. The Betti number is another.

### Singular Chains and Their Boundaries

First we introduce the geometric building block, the `standard p-simplex`, or sometimes called the euclidean p-simplex. It is the convex set $\Delta_ {p} \subset \mathbb{R}^{p}$ generated by the $p+1$ points, 
$$
p_ {0} = (0,\dots,0), \quad p_ {1} = (1,0,\dots,0), \dots, p_ {p} = (0,\dots,0,1).
$$

We shall write 
$$
\Delta_ {p} = (p_ {0}, \dots, p_ {p}).
$$
In barycentric coordinates, we can write
$$
\Delta_ {p} = \left\{ (a_ {0}p_ {0} + \dots + a_ {p} p_ {p}) \,\middle\vert\, \sum a_ {i}=1 \text{ and } a_ {i}>0 \right\}.
$$
Simplex is a generalization of the notion of a triangle to arbitrary dimension. It is so-named because it represents the simplest possible `polytope` ( a geometric object with flat sides) in any given dimension.  

A `singular` p-simplex is something defined in a given manifold, no longer in $\mathbb{R}^{p}$. It is a **differentiable map**
$$
\boxed{
\sigma_ {p} : \Delta_ {p} \to M^{n},
}
$$
of a standard p-simplex into M. We shall use $\sigma_ {p}$ to denote both the map itself and the image of the map.

![[/img/Pasted image 20230324111922.png]]

Note that singular simplexes are **the natural object over which one integrates p-forms of M via the pull-back**
$$
\boxed{
\int _ {\sigma} \,  \alpha^{p} := \int _ {\Delta} \, \sigma ^\ast \alpha^{p}. 
}
$$
We emphasis that there is no restriction on the map $\sigma_ {p}$, for example, the image of it could very well be a point, we don't care. It is possible because there is no restriction on the maps we use for pull-backs. Maybe that's why it is called `singular` simplex, because the image can be singular.

We will talk about the surface of p-simplexes, thus we need to introduce the concept `face`. First let us define faces for the standard simplexes. The $k$-th face $\Delta_ {p-1}^{(k)}$ of $\Delta_ {p}$ is something one dimension less:
$$
\Delta_ {p-1}^{(k)} := (p_ {0},\dots,\widehat{p_ {k}}, \dots, p_ {p})
$$
where the hatted vertex is supposed to be deleted. We could say the the k-th face is the face opposite the vertex $p_ {k}$. Note that, restrictively speaking, the k-th face is not itself a standard simplex for it is a $p-1$ dimensional object in $p$ dimensional space; instead, we consider it as a **singular** simplex in $\mathbb{R}^{p}$, given by the map
$$
f_ {k} : \Delta_ {p-1} \to \Delta_ {p}.
$$
To be mathematically accurate, $f_ {k}$ is the *unique* affine map (i.e., a linear map followed by a translation of origin) of $\mathbb{R}^{p-1}$ into $\mathbb{R}^{p}$ that sends $p_ {0}\to p_ {0},\dots, p_ {k-1}\to p_ {k-1},p_ {k}\to p_ {k+1},\dots,p_ {p-1}\to p_ {p}$, namely we jumped the $k$-th point in $\mathbb{R}_ {P-1}$. But this is just making things more complicated. 

The composition of maps naturally gives us the composition of the construction of singular simplexes. Let $\sigma$ be a singular simplex in $M$ and a map $\phi: M \to V$, then $\phi\;\circ\;\sigma$ defines a singular simplex in $V$. In particular $\sigma \;\circ\;f_ {k}: \Delta_ {p-1}\to M$ defines a singular simplecial face in $M$.

Given the image of a simplex we can easily read off the boundary of it. In algebraic topology, we want to study such intuitive, geometric operations using algebraic method, thus we want to find a algebraic operator that gives us the boundary of a simplex. In this spirit, we define the boundary $\partial\Delta_ {p}$ of the standard p-simplex, to be the **formal sum** (formal means we don't ask the meaning about the result of the summation, just regard summation as a formal operation, in this sense we are allow to add one apple to one square) of singular simplexes,
$$
\partial \Delta_ {p} = \partial (p_ {0},\dots,p_ {p}) := \sum_ {k}(-1)^{k} (p_ {0},\dots,\widehat{p_ {k}}, \dots,p_ {p}) = \sum_ {k}(-1)^{k} \Delta_ {p-1}^{(k)}
$$
whereas for the $0$-simplex we put $\partial\Delta_ {0}=0$. 
![[/img/Pasted image 20230324120315.png]]

$\Delta_ {2}$ is an `ordered` simplex, that is, it is ordered by the given order of its vertices. From this ordering we may extract an `orientation`. The ordering is defined to be given by $\mathbf{e}_ {1} = (p_ {1}p_ {1}) = p_ {0} -p_ {1}$ and $\mathbf{e}_ {2}=(p_ {0}p_ {2}) = p_ {2}-p_ {0}$. *We think of the minus sign in front of $(p_ {0}p_ {2})$ as effectively reversing the orientation of this simplex.*  It should come naturally. We define the orientation of the boundary in this way such that the Stoke's theorem for a 1-form $\alpha$ in the plane can be express in the neat form:
$$
\int_ {\partial \Delta} \, \alpha = \int _ {\Delta} \,   d\alpha.
\tag{1}
$$
If we write the integral in a different form, define some kind of a "inner product" between a differential form and a simplex on which it integrate, 
$$
\left\langle \Delta, \omega \right\rangle :=  \int _ {\Delta} \, \omega
$$
then Eq. (1) can be written as 
$$
\left\langle \partial \Delta , \alpha \right\rangle  = \left\langle \Delta,d\alpha \right\rangle,
$$
and we may say that $\partial$ is the dual operation to $d$.

The boundary of a simplex is itself not a simplex, since it is a formal sum of simplexes. It is an example of a new type of object, an `integer chain`. To be specif, the boundary $\partial\Delta_ {p}$ is an integer $(p-1)$-chain. For topological purposes it is necessary, and no more difficult, to allow much more general coefficients than merely $\pm 1$, or integer in that sense. Let $G$ be any abelian, that is, commutative, group. The main groups of interest to us are
- $G=\mathbb{Z}$, the group of integers.
- $G=\mathbb{R}$, the *additive* group of real numbers.
- $G=\mathbb{Z}_ {2} = \mathbb{Z} / 2 \mathbb{Z}$, the group of integers mod 2.

The notation $\mathbb{Z} / 2 \mathbb{Z}$ means that in the group $\mathbb{Z}$ of integers we shall identify any two integers that differ by an even integer, that is, an element of the subgroup $2\mathbb{Z}$. The elements of $2\mathbb{Z}$ are two equivalent classes in $\mathbb{Z}$, namely $[0]$ and $[1]$, where it is conventional to use square brackets to denote the equivalent class.

We define a (singular) `p-chain` on $M$, , with **coefficients in the abelian group** $G$, to be a **finite** formal sum
$$
c_ {p} = g_ {1}\sigma_ {p}^{1}+\dots+g_ {r}\sigma_ {p}^{r},\quad g_ {i} \in  G.
$$

This formal definition means the following. The p-chain can be considered as a function defined on all the singular complexes, whose value at $\sigma_ {p}^{i}$ is $g_ {i}$. So a p-chain is a function 
$$
p-\text{chain } : \text{ singular complexes} \to G.
$$
It has the property that its value is zero for all but finite simplexes. 

We add two p-chains by simply adding the functions, namely adding the coefficients for same simplexes. 

The collection of all singular p-chains of $M$ with coefficients in $G$ themselves form an abelian group, the `singular p-chain group` of $M$ with coefficients in $G$, written 
$$
\boxed{
C_ {p}(M^{n};G)
} =: \text{ the group of p-chains on }M.
$$

A chain with integer coefficients will be called simply an integer chain.

For example, we can talk about the group of chains of standard simplexes, denoted $C_ {p}(\mathbb{R}^{p};\mathbb{Z})$. 

Recall that a `homomorphism` of an abelian group $G$ into another abelian group $H$ is a map that preserves the addition. Let 
$$
F: M \to V
$$
be a map, we have already seen that if $\sigma$ is a singular simplex of $F$ then the composition $F \;\circ\; \sigma$ is a singular simplex of $V$. We extend $F_ {\ast}$ to be a homomorphism, called the `induced chain homomorphism`, we just push everything on $M$ to $V$. There is nothing much to say about it.

A natural question to ask is, given a chain, what is its boundary? One might guess, the boundary should be another chain with one less dimension. It turns out to be correct. Starting from the simplest situation, a single complex. If $\sigma: \Delta \to M$ is a singular simplex on $M$, its boundary $\partial\sigma$ is a $(p-1)$-chain defined as follows. Recall that $\partial\Delta_ {p}$ is the $(p-1)$ integer chain 
$$
\partial \Delta = \sum_ {k} (-1)^{k}\Delta^{(k)}_ {p-1},
$$
we then define
$$
\partial \sigma:= \sigma_ {\ast } \partial  \Delta_ {p} = \sum_ {k} (-1)^{k}\sigma_ {\ast }\Delta^{(k)}_ {p-1} = \sum_ {k}(-1)^{k} \sigma^{(k)}_ {p-1}.
$$
Roughly speaking, **the boundary of the image of $\Delta$ is the image of the boundary of $\Delta$!** Taking boundary and map are two commutative operations. 

Finally, we define the boundary of any singular p-chain with coefficients in $G$ by
$$
\partial  \sum_ {r} g_ {r} \sigma^{r}_ {p} = \sum_ {r} g_ {r} \partial \sigma^{r}_ {p}.
$$
How else can you define it?

By construction we then have the `boundary homomorphism`
$$
\partial : C_ {p}(M; G) \to C_ {p-1}(M; G).
$$

The following statement combines algebra and geometric intuition perfectly. The boundary of a boundary is zero! That is,

**Theorem.**
$$
\partial ^{2} = \partial \;\circ\;\partial =0.
$$

Interested readers can try to prove it by yourself.

**Some 2-Dimensional Examples.**

The `cylinder` Cyl is the familiar rectangular band with the two vertical edges brought together by bending and then sewn together. We wish to exhibit a specific integer 2-chain on Cyl. On the right we have the rectangular band and we have labeled six vertices. The labels on the two vertical edges are the same, since the band is to be bent and the two edges are to be sewn.
![[/img/Pasted image 20230324162041.png]]

On the band we have indicated six singular (ordered) 2-simplexes. We shall always write a singular simplex with vertices in increasing order. For example, the singular simplex $(Q_ {1}Q_ {3}Q_ {4})$ is the image of a map of $(P_ {0} P_ {1} P_ {2})$ to the band. After the band is bent and sewn we shall then have a singular 2-simplex on Cyl that we shall again call $(Q_ {1}Q_ {3}Q_ {4})$. We have thus broken Cyl up into 2-simplexes, and we have used enough simplexes so that any 1- or 2-simplex is uniquely determined by its vertices.

Regard the whole band as a 2-chain, where the simplex carries the orientation indicated in the figure. Since we always write a simplex with increasing order to its vertices, we put
$$
c_ {2}=(Q_ {0}Q_ {1}Q_ {2})-(Q_ {0}Q_ {1}Q_ {3})+\dots
$$
Then we can write down the expression for the boundary of the "triangulation" of Cyl. It is tedious but straightforward. 

It can be shown that the boundary is made of the top edge and bottom edge, with reversed directions.

The next example would be the famous Mobius strip, however we will leave it as a home work. Note that, due to the non-orientable nature of the Mobius band, the property of its boundary will be rather strange.
